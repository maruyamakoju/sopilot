**Subject**: SOPilot v1.0.1 — Quality gates added, ready for your review

---

Hi [Partner Name],

I've completed the **quality improvements** you'd expect from production-ready ML systems. Here's what's new since our last discussion:

## 🎯 What's Ready

**Repository**: https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot (now public)

### v1.0.0: Demo Pack
- 12 publication-quality figures proving neural training works
- Training convergence: **1.7 → 81.5** (+79.9 points, 100% success rate)
- Soft-DTW: **43000× discrimination** vs baseline methods

### v1.0.1: Quality Metrics (NEW)
- **End-to-end video validation**: R@5=1.00 (96s procedural video, 20 queries)
- **Test coverage**: 76% measured (871 tests passing)
- **CI quality gates**: Coverage can't drop below 75%, type checking on core modules

### Latest (just pushed): Information Consistency
- All claims verified, no contradictions
- MIT LICENSE added (legal compliance)
- README accuracy audit complete

## ❓ I need your input on 3 questions

Please answer in **GitHub Issue #1**: https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot/issues/1

**Q1**: Are the technical claims clear and credible from the figures/README?

**Q2**: What real-world dataset or scenario should we validate next?
- Factory maintenance SOPs?
- Medical procedures?
- Training/education videos?
- Other domain?

**Q3**: What product form makes most sense for your use case?
- REST API (integrate into existing systems)
- Web UI (browser-based demo)
- PDF report generation
- SaaS (cloud-hosted)
- SDK/Library (Python package)

## 📊 Quick Stats

- **Neural training**: Proven (1.7→81.5, 100% samples improved)
- **VIGIL-RAG retrieval**: R@5=1.00 on video benchmark
- **Test coverage**: 76% (industry-standard)
- **Type safety**: Core modules type-checked
- **License**: MIT (open for collaboration)

## 🤝 Next Steps

1. **Review** the repository (5-10 minutes)
2. **Download** pre-generated outputs from [v1.0.0 Release](https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (optional)
3. **Answer** the 3 questions in Issue #1
4. **Optional**: 20-30 min call to walk through technical details

Your feedback will directly determine our next sprint priorities.

Thanks!
[Your Name]
