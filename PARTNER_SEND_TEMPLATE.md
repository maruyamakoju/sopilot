Hi `<Name>`,

I'd love your feedback on **SOPilot** (Neural SOP Scoring + VIGIL-RAG).

**1) Repository** (README top has 3 key figures for 30-second proof):
https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot

**2) Pre-generated demo outputs** (no setup needed):
https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot/releases/tag/v1.0.0
- **demo_outputs_v1.0.zip** (Windows)
- **demo_outputs_v1.0.tar.gz** (Linux/Mac)

**3) Review guide** (3 minutes total):
https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot/blob/master/PARTNER_REVIEW_GUIDE.md

**Please answer only these 3 questions** (post as comment here):
https://github.com/maruyamakoju/sopilot/issues/1

**A)** Are the technical claims clear/credible from the figures & README?

**B)** What real-world dataset / scenario should we validate next?

**C)** What product form makes most sense (API / UI / SaaS / research demo)?

---

If you're open, I'd also appreciate a **20–30 min call** to walk through results.

Thanks!
`<you>`
